  Contributed by Filip Kis

Version 6.4
-----------
- Added support for Utra High Definition (4k) Videos:
	- Added a Custom Video Output Preset (shown in the "Video" section of the Export/Publish Service dialog) that enables the upload of rendered videos with original resolution. This is useful in particular for 4k Videos, because Lr supports upload of rendered videos only up to FullHD resolution
	- Added a seperate config setting for additional videos for UHD videos with the Export/Publish Service dialog
- Show current processed image as caption in the progess bar

Version 6.3
-----------
- Added support for __download of public comments__ from Photo Station (comments added to a public Shared Album in Photo Station)
- Configurable download options for private and/or public comments (downloading public comments is much faster than downloading private comments)
- Added plugin metadata for comments:  this allows to __search for or filter photos with comments__
- Added __Metadata tagsets__ that include Photo StatLr's comment metadata
- Added pattern matching for metadata placeholder {LrCC}: extract parts from the Contained Collection path or name
- Bugfixes:
	- Fixed an exception when a public Shared Album was modified to a private Shared Album
	- Fixed an issue where Shared Album keyword synonyms were not handled correctly
	- Fixed an issue where a comment that was removed in PS was not removed in Lr 

Version 6.2
------------
- Added	metadata placeholder __{LrRM:\<key\> \<extract pattern\>}__ to retrieve (an extract of) any metadata supported by Lightroom SDK: LrPhoto - photo:getRawMetadata(key)<br>
This placeholder was introduced in particular to support the following features:
	- __{LrRM:uuid}__ may be used in 'Rename to' to retrieve a unique, fixed, never changing identifier for any photo in the Lr catalog
	- __{LrRM:stackPositionInFolder ^1([^%d]*)$|?}__ may be used in 'Rename to' to prevent the upload of any photo burried in a stack (not the top-most photo in a stack)    
 
Version 6.1
------------
- Added __"Photo Station 6.6"__ as configurable Photo Station version
- __Removed__ setting "Generate Thumbs __For PS 6__", setting is now derived from configured Photo Station version 
- Photo Station Shared Album management: You may define a __password for the public share__ (requires Photo 6.6 or above)
- Added translations for various listboxes

Version 6.0
------------
- Added __Photo Station Shared Album__ management: Define __Shared Album keywords__ under "Photo StatLr" | "Shared Albums" | "\<Publish Service Name\>" and assign them to photos you want to link to Photo Station Shared Albums.
  As soon as you publish the respective photos (using Publish mode "Upload" or "CheckExisting") via the given \<Publish Service\>, they will be linked to or removed from the given Shared Albums
- Fully localizable version: a German and (partially) Korean translation is available. If you like to see your name in the Plugin, please contribute a translation file. Instructions for translation file contribution can be found in __[this Wiki article](https://github.com/flingo64/PhotoStation-Upload-Lr-Plugin/wiki/Contributions:-How-to-contribute-a-translation-for-Photo-StatLr.)__!  
- In case of an plugin exception:
	- the progress bar will be removed
	- the exception text will be copied to the logfile
- Other minor bugfixes 

Version 5.10
------------
- Added metadata placeholder __{Path:\<level\> \<extract pattern\>}__ to retrieve the (extract of the) \<level\>st directory name of the photo's pathname.<br>

Version 5.9
-----------
- Added __Rename Photos To__ to achieve a unique naming schema for photos in the target album.<br>
  This also allows to merge photos with same names from different sub folder into a single target album.    
- Extended metadata placeholders of type {LrFM:key} to include an extract pattern:<br>
  __{LrFM:key \<extractPattern\>}__<br>
  The extract pattern (a Lua regex pattern which optional captures) allows to extract specific parts from the given metadata key
- Change the automatic renaming of virtual copies in the target album:<br>
  Before virtual copies got a suffix of the last 3 digits of the photo UUID, now they get the copy name as suffix    

Version 5.8
-----------
- Added __Default Collection__ handling: the Default Collection now serves as template for all new Published (Smart) Collections within the same Publish Service.  
- Bugfix for "Convert all photos": This bug was introduced in V5.4.0

Version 5.7
-----------
- Added new publish mode "MovePhotos" to move photo remotely in the Photo Station instead of deleting the photo at the old location and re-generating thumbs and uploading the photos again
- Addes download mode setting (Yes, No, Ask me later)
- Bugfixes / improvements:
	- Fixed a bug where after deleting photos from a Published Collection the DeleteEmptyAlbum routine was called multiple times for albums with a '-' in the path
	- Avoid the call of doExifTranslations when there is nothing to translate
	- Fixed a bug where RAW/DNG photos could not be uploaded from MacOS (due to a mis-configured program path for the dcraw tool)
	- Raised the timeout for uploading metadata for videos from 30 sec to 60 sec
	- Fixed an issue where one or more upload task would fail with an exception ("PSUtilities, 331: attempt to compare nil with number") when doing multiple upload tasks in parallel  

Version 5.6
-----------
- Support for __download of (native) rating__ for photos and videos from __Photo Station 6.5__ and above<br>
- Performance improvement __(up to 10 times faster)__ for publish mode __CheckExisting__ and __download of title, caption, rating and gps__ through introduction of a local Photo Station album cache

Version 5.5
-----------
- Support for __GPS info download__ for photos and videos<br>
GPS coords can be added in Photo Station via the Location Tag panel: enter a location name / address and let Google look up the coords (blue pin) or position a red pin in the map view via right-click. Photo Station will write red pin coords also to the photo itself. Red pin coords have preference over blue pin coords when downloading GPS info. 

Version 5.4
-----------
- Support for __GPS info upload for videos__. GPS info will be read __from Lr GPS tag__ and __from the video itself__. Videos w/ embedded GPS info (e.g __GoPro, iPhone6__) will be uploaded w/ GPS info to PS GPS tag, even though Lr does not support GPS info in videos.
If GPS info is availabe both in the video and in Lr (manually tagged), Lr GPS info has precedence.<br>
GPS upload will respect the metadata privacy settings in the metadata section of the Export / Publish Service dialog.
- Support for __person tags download__ is now also available __for RAW photos and rotated photos__. For RAW photos, the face region metadata are now written to the XMP side-car file (not to the RAW file itself), which is the correct place for all additional metadata. 
Face regions for rotated photos are now correctly back rotated. 
Face region download is not possible for virtual copies, since it would overwrite the metadata in the original photo.<br> Face region download is also __not possible for cropped photos__ due to an import incompatibility of Lr: Lr will not accept face regions from XMP for a cropped photo which was written there by Lr itself. :-(
- Sync PS general tags w/ __Lr keyword hierarchies and synonyms__
- Respect __"Include on Export"__ setting for Lr keywords when synching with PS general tags
- Support for __adding hierarchical keywords from PS__:<br>
Use '|' as delimiter for keywords, e.g. 'animal|bird|eagle'  

Version 5.3
-----------
- Support for __person tags download__ (face regions) to original photo (requires reloading the photo in Lr)
- Download: when Label is not selected for download,  Label tags (e.g. '+green') in PS will not be download as Lr keywords 
- Download: when Rating is not selected for download,  rating tags (e.g. '***') in PS will not be download as Lr keywords 
- Upload: Photo title is now also added as PS title tag on upload
- Bugfixes:
	- Rejected photos due to missing photo title was fixed
	- An exception in case of exporting (not publishing) of a video was fixed
	- An exception in case of two parallel plugin threads running was fixed 

Version 5.2
-----------
- Download of __title__
- Support for __metadata__ upload and download for __videos__  
- Introduced a strict '__Do not delete metadata__ in Lr when downloading from Photo Station__' policy 

Version 5.1
-----------
- Added "Convert all photos" to General Settings in Plugin Manager section

Version 5.0
-----------
- Plugin renamed to __Photo StatLr__ using a new icon
- Added metadata translation for Lr __color labels__ to PS general tag like __'+green', '+red',__ etc.
- Support for __Add comment__ to Published Photo and __Get Comments/Get ratings__ (optional) from Published Collection<br>
  This requires some more data in the published photo objects, therefore published photos need to be converted once to the new format in order to support this feature
- Publish Mode: __CheckMoved__ is now also available for Collection with dynamic target album definitions (i.e. including metadata placeholder)
- New Publish Mode: __Convert__ to convert published photos to V5.0 format to enable Get Comments and Get Ratings
- __Download of metadata__: description, general tags__  
- __Download and translation of special general tags: color label, rating__
- Configuration of __program install paths__ (Syno Uploader and exiftool) is now moved to the Plugin general settings in __Plugin Manager__ dialog
- Error output of convert, dcraw and exiftool are now redirected to the logfile
- Error output of JSON decoder is now redirected to the logfile instead of a message box popping up
- Bugfixes:
	- Adjustments for __Show in Photo Station__
	- Fixes for __Update Check__
  
Version 4.0
-----------
- __FileStation API no longer required: yeah, finally got rid of it!___
- Support for photo __sort order__ of Published Collections in Photo Station album on __flat uploads__
- Support for __RAW+JPG to same Album__
- '__Delete__ Photos in Published Collection' and 'Delete Published Collection' will now __remove empty albums__ on Photo Station
- Support for mirroring of local Collection Set hierarchies via metadata placeholder '{LrCC:...}'
- __Video__ Upload will now __delete__ the video in PS __before uploading__ the new video(s):<br>
	PhotosStation would otherwise keep old versions of the video which were uploaded before
- Logfile handling:
	- now includes Loglevel of messages
	- will now be truncated at the beginning of a session if logfile is older than 5 minutes 
- Bugfixes:
	- Metadata placeholder {Date ..} is now more robust: will also find DateTimeDigitized and other alternative timestamps if DateTimeOriginal is missing
	- Processed videos will now be uploaded with the correct filename extension

Version 3.7
------------
- Support for __metadata placeholders__ in __target album__ definitions (Export, Published Collection, Published Collection Set):
	- {Date \<format\>} for capture date/time (dateTimeOriginal) related metadata
	- {LrFM:\<key\>} for any metadata supported by Lightroom SDK: LrPhoto - photo:getFormattedMetadata(key)
- __Show in Photo Station__ now works for Published Photos, Collections and Collection Sets.<br>
  Will not work for Collections and Collection Sets that include metadata placeholders in the target album definition.	
- __Standard timeout__ for Photo Station communication (for Login, album creation) is now __configurable__ in Export/Publish dialog.
- Timeout calculation for uploads is now calculated based on a minimum of 10 MBit/s (was 24MBit/s before).
- Video upload:
	- besides .mp4 files now also __.m4v__ files are handle as natively supported by Photo Station, thus need __no conversion__.
	- any __not natively supported video format__ (e.g. .avi, .mov, .3gp) will be converted to .mp4 format and now be __uploaded in addition__ to the original video (rather than replacing the original video)
	- Bugfix: video dimensions will always be even integers. When videos are rotated or scaled (e.g. when additional video upload is configured), it could happen the the resulting width was an odd integer, which was not supported by ffmpeg.
	- Bugfix: thumb from video will be extracted at 00:00:00 sec for videos shorter than 4 seconds, otherwise at 00:00:03. Upload of video with duration < 1 sec failed in earlier versions due to failed thumb extraction ( at 00:00:01). 
	
Version 3.6
------------
- Support for Published Collection Sets:
	- Published Collection Sets may be associated with a target dir (format: dir{/subdir}). The target dir will be inherited by all child collections or collection sets
	- Published Collection Sets may be nested to any level
- Modified Metadata trigger for Published Collections: now any metadata change (incl. rating) will trigger a photo state change to "To be re-published"
  __Important Note__: It is likely, that a bunch of photos will change to state "To be re-published" due to the modified trigger definition. Please make sure __all photos__ of all your collections are in state __"Published" before updating__ from older versions to V3.6.x! This allows you to identify which photos are affected by this change and you may then use __"Check Existing" to quickly "re-publish"__ those photos.

- Use of '\'  is now tolerated in all target album definitions

Version 3.5
------------
- Support for Lr and Picasa face detection/recognition:<br>
Translation of the Lr/Picasa face regions to PhotoStatio Face regions / Person tags
- Support for star ratings ( * to ***** ): <br>
Translation of the XMP-rating tag to Photo Station General * tags
- Support for Photo-only Upload

Version 3.4
------------
- Second server address configurable also for Export
- FileStation API access optional for Publish:<br>
Until v3.3 FileStation API access was required for any Publish operation mode. So, if you wanted to use the Publish functionality via Internet, the FileStation had to be accessible via Internet.
Since most of us don't feel comfortable with the idea of opening the admin port of the diskstation to the Internet, publishing via Internet wasn't really an option. 
Now, you may use choose to __disable FileStation API use for the Internet access__ case.
Publish mode 'Check Existing', photo deletion and photo movement will not be possible via Internet then, but you will be able at least to __upload photos using the Publish service via Internet__. Hey, that's better than nothing, isn't it?
- Publish: Delete after Upload<br>
The order or Publish tasks was rearranged, so that you may use the Publish function via Internet w/o being stopped by photos that need to be deleted, but cannot be deleted due to disabled FileStation access (see above).
- 'Check Existing' is 4 times faster than before:<br>
A directory read cache speeds up the check for photos in Photo Station. The actual speed advantage is depending on how your photo collections are organized in your Photo Station. any kind of chronological directory structure will work fine, since Lr is processing photos in chronological order. 

Version 3.3
------------
- Support for upload of TIFF and DNG file format to Photo Station
- 3.3.2: Support for upload of varous RAW file formats (when uploading original photos):<br>
  3FR, ARW, CR2, DCR, DNG, ERF, MEF, MRW, NEF, ORF, PEF, RAF, RAW, RW2, SR2, X3F
	
Version 3.2
------------
- Configurable thumbnail sharpening (see issue #3)<br>
